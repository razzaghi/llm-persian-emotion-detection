This project fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) to analyze Persian text and classify it into emotion labels for applications like sentiment analysis and content moderation.

# Emotion Detection in Persian Text using Fine-Tuned LLM
This project focuses on fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to analyze Persian text, specifically comments, and detect human emotions. The model will be trained to recognize a wide range of emotions expressed in Persian, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more, based on the sentiment and tone of the text.

## Key Features:
- Persian Text Analysis: The model is designed to process and understand Persian language nuances in the context of emotional expression.
- Emotion Classification: Capable of classifying various emotions, including but not limited to joy, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality.
- Fine-Tuning on Domain-Specific Data: The LLM will be fine-tuned on a custom dataset of Persian comments to improve its accuracy in emotion detection in user-generated content.
- Multimodal Application: Can be used for a variety of applications such as social media comment analysis, sentiment tracking, and customer feedback analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- Transformers Library: Leveraging the Hugging Face transformers library for fine-tuning large pre-trained language models.
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: Used for model training and evaluation.
- Persian Text Preprocessing: Incorporates methods to clean and preprocess Persian text for effective model training.

## Potential Use Cases:
- Social Media Monitoring: Detecting emotional trends in comments and posts on Persian social media platforms.
- Customer Sentiment Analysis: Analyzing customer reviews and feedback in Persian to understand emotional sentiments.
- Content Moderation: Identifying harmful or offensive emotional content in user comments.

## How to Contribute:
Feel free to contribute by submitting issues, pull requests, or suggestions for improvement. Whether you're interested in adding more data, improving preprocessing methods, or enhancing the model's performance, your contributions are welcome!
